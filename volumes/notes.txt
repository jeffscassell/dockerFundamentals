create a container that has access to a directory on the local file system
(bind mount)

the `volumes` service element is used for both bind mounts and
volumes (and tmpfs and npipes).

bind mount:
used when the user needs to interact with the files within the volume,
such as configuration files so they can be manually edited, source code
that needs to be edited on the fly, etc.

volume:
managed by docker so it's difficult for the user to interact with the files
within directly, but easy to use. if multiple containers want to share a
volume, the volume must be declared in the volumes top-level element (not
under the services element).
